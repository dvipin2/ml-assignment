# Problem statement
Implement binary classification models for classifying Brest Cancer dataset as Benign vs Malignent

# Dataset description 
This dataset contain Diagnostic Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database. As per official website, Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.  They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. A few of the images can be found at http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~street/images/

c. Models used:  Comparison Table with the evaluation metrics calculated for all the 6 models as below:
